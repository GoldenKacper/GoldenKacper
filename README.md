<h3 align="left">Short about me:</h3>
<a>I have been passionate about programming for a long time, it started with writing websites in HTML and CSS, then C # and C ++, up to studies where we tried many different languages and environments. Sometimes in my free time I do my projects or devote it to study programming. My two favorite languages are C++ and Python, I feel good and I like coding in them. On a daily basis, I try to reconcile my studies, work and private life with the addition of implementing my own projects. During the holidays I read a book about clean code and also looked at a website that showed how to improve my python programming skills. It took a few weeks, but I don't regret it, I had the opportunity to use the acquired knowledge in practice and I feel that the quality of the software I created has increased significantly. </a>

<h4>1)</h4>
 My first large C++ project done entirely by me is: https://github.com/GoldenKacper/Garden-Shop.git </br>
This is software for a gardening store. At that time, this project turned out to be quite an undertaking and allowed me to complete a milestone on my path as a programmer. I gained a lot of theory which I tried to put into practice. Thanks to it, I learned, among other things:

  - object-oriented approach in C++
  - using libraries
  - git support
  - writing CMakeLists
  - writing unit tests

and many others, which are described in more detail in the readme.md of this project on github.
I made it a year ago, since then I have caught a lot of mistakes I made in it, I have learned a lot since then.
</br>
<h4>2)</h4> 
A project currently being written in C# by the duo: https://github.com/GoldenKacper/Concurrent-Programming.git </br>
It was born out of a desire to learn concurrent programming. The idea of ​​the project itself is very simple, it is simply balls bouncing off the walls and each other, but it provides a lot of scope for learning various programming techniques.
The most important things I learn while working on this project are:

  - concurrent programming
  - multithreaded programming
  -  asynchronous programming
  -  use of the critical section
  -  making window applications
  -  using the MVVM pattern

I describe more benefits of this project in the readme.md file.
</br>
<h4>3)</h4> 
The desire to learn and develop towards artificial intelligence resulted in the creation of this project: https://github.com/Tomunek/ISD.git </br>
Intelligent State Detector is a project in which, as a group of 4 people, we try to make a device that will enable the examination of the state of the user who wears it. For this we use a neural network that I created and implemented in C without using libraries. Detailed plans for the network and the entire project are in the GitHub repository.
I gained knowledge in the field of:

  - Operations of neural networks
  - Forward propagation
  - Backpropagation
  - mathematics
  - C programming

Apart from the theory itself, which I had to master to perfection, including mathematics, I also learned to use this knowledge. It is worth noting that the project is still in the production phase, but the neural network has already been written.
